# Generated Reports

This folder contains all markdown reports generated by Perplexity searches.

Reports are automatically saved here when you request a search with a filename.

## Example

```
Search for "AI trends 2025" and save to ai_trends.md
```

This will create `reports/ai_trends.md` automatically.

## Organization Tips

- Use descriptive filenames: `Psoriasis_Therapien_2025.md`
- Include dates in filenames for tracking: `Market_Analysis_2025-11-23.md`
- Create subfolders if needed: `reports/pharma/Psoriasis_2025.md`

All reports are ignored by git (see `.gitignore`) to keep the repository clean.
